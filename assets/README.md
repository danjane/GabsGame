# Asset Layout

Place downloaded game images in these folders:

- `assets/sprites/player/` - player animation frames
- `assets/sprites/trees/` - tree sprites/animation frames
- `assets/sprites/stones/` - stone sprites
- `assets/sprites/house/` - house/building sprites
- `assets/ui/` - UI icons/buttons (optional)

Suggested naming for animation frames:
- `player_idle_01.png`, `player_idle_02.png`, ...
- `player_walk_01.png`, `player_walk_02.png`, ...

Use lowercase names and underscores for consistency.
